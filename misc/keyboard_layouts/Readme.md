# [2023]
The layout images here correspond to these setxkbmap configuration 
options (including models/layout/etc):

-layout 'de' # German
-layout 'es' # Spanish
-layout 'il' # Hebrew
-layout 'ru' -variant ',,phonetic' # Russian

Also, with all these layouts "Alt Gr" key produces much more characters 
than represented in images, and "Shift + Alt Gr" produces even more.
